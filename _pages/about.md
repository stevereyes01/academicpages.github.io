I am currently a graduate student researcher at Syracuse University in the Physics Department studying gravitational wave astronomy. I was formerly affiliated with the [Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) and even helped in confirming the validity of [the first discovery of gravitational waves from two merging black holes](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102). It is a great time to be part of the transition from Physics and Theoretical Physics into Physics and Astrophysics. I am currently part of an independent team of gravitational wave astrophysicists here at Syracuse University.

I am an astrophysicist who works with very large data sets coming from the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors. To check up on the status of the detectors you can visit the [Gravitational Wave Open Science Center](https://www.gw-openscience.org/about/). I have worked on everything from the search for classes of gravitational wave events, to inferences on non-detected events, to astrophysical modeling, to Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection. You can use the top banner to navigate between some of the pages I have listed above. Here you can learn more about my experience mentoring and public outreach, my research projects, publications, talks, a tutorials and blog page, and finally my resume and an unabridged curriculum vitae. If you have any questions or concerns about this page, please feel free to contact me using the contact information on the left side-bar.
