[Steven Reyes' curriculum vitae](https://stevereyes01.github.io/files/Steven_Reyes_CV.pdf)

Below we have a more descriptive and informal statement of what I have done
and where I come from.

Education
======
* B.A. in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from the University of Chicago, 2014
* Ph.D in Physics from Syracuse University, Expected 2019, 

Work experience
======
* May 2015 - Current: Graduate Research Assistant
  * Syracuse University
  * Advisor: Duncan Brown

* 2012 - 2013 : [CARMA](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/research/carma/) data analyst
  * University of Chicago
  * Advisor: John Carlstrom
 
Skills
======
* Software Development:
  * Python, Bash scripting, Jupyter Notebooks, Mathematica, HTCondor, C++, Java, Fortran
  * Contributor to the open source gravitational wave analysis package [PyCBC](https://github.com/gwastro/pycbc)
* Data Analysis Skills:
  * Python:
    * Numerical interpolation and integration techniques (approximants, splines, polynomials, Monte Carlo)
    * Signal processing (cross-correlation, matched filtering)
    * Bayesian parameter estimation / inference (Astrophysical modeling and parameter model building) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation
    * Bayesian model selection / comparison (Bayes factors, information criterion, model-marginalization) with Markove Chain Monte Carlo simulation
    * Data visualization
    * Frequentist p-value null hypothesis testing
    * Resampling techniques (Bootstrap, Jackknife, Cross-Validation)
    * Probability density estimation techniques
  * Computational Parallelization:
    * HTCondor and Pegasus WMS for high-throughput-computing, job scheduling, workflow management, and dashboard visualization.
    * Have used Open MPI for high performance computing but I do not claim to fully understand how it works.
* Languages:
  * English (Native):
    * I am very loquacious.
    * In my free time I like to invent circumlocutory and periphrastic phrases.
    * Sometimes use code-switching with Spanish or English-dialects.
  * Spanish (Native):
    * More receptive billingualism than full fluency.
    * I spoke very nicely and confidently  as a child.
    * I can read and write given enough time. The Spanish AP exams was easy for me.
    * I should practice this.
